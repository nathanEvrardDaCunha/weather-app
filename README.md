# Weather App - Learning Journey

**Last Modified**: February 11, 2025  
**Author**: EVRARD-DA CUNHA Nathan

## Project Overview

This project serves as a self-assessment exercise to evaluate and improve my development practices following my computer science bachelor's degree. While the weather application itself is straightforward in terms of functionality and design, the development process revealed numerous learning opportunities in areas that were either not covered or minimally addressed during my academic studies.

While my computer science degree provided a strong theoretical foundation, this project represents my initiative to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry practices. As a junior developer, I've used this opportunity to explore practical aspects of web development that complement my formal education.

The insights gained from this project span multiple aspects of modern web development, from project organization to specific technical implementations. This document catalogs these learnings to serve as a reference for future projects.

## Moving Forward

This document serves as both a reflection of my current learning gaps and a roadmap for future improvement. Each identified area represents an opportunity for growth and will be addressed in future projects and continued learning efforts.

## Current Status

This README represents a comprehensive post-project review completed after the weather application's initial development. The observations and improvements noted throughout this document were identified during a thorough code review process. While these areas for enhancement have been documented, they remain as future improvement opportunities and have not yet been implemented in the current codebase. This documentation serves as a valuable reference for future iterations of this project and other development work.
